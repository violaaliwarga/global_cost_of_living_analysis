# **Global Cost of Living Analysis: Uncovering Trends and Insights from 2024 Mid-Year Data**

### **1. Introduction**
This report analyzes global cost of living data from Numbeo’s 2024 mid-year index, comparing key metrics—rent, groceries, restaurants, and local purchasing power—to New York City. The goal is to identify affordable regions, areas with the highest expenses, and how these factors impact local purchasing power.

**Dataset Source**:  
Data was sourced from [Numbeo](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings_by_country.jsp) and downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/myrios/cost-of-living-index-by-country-by-number-2024).

### **2. Objectives**
1. Identify global trends in cost of living, rent, groceries, and restaurant expenses.
2. Compare regions and countries to highlight significant differences in cost of living.
3. Analyze the relationship between local purchasing power and the cost of living.
4. Provide actionable insights for individuals, businesses, and governments.

### **3. Data Overview**
- **Cost of Living Index (Excl. Rent)**: Measures relative prices of consumer goods compared to New York City (NYC) with NYC as the baseline (index = 100).
- **Rent Index**: Estimates the cost of renting apartments in various cities relative to NYC.
- **Cost of Living Plus Rent Index**: Combines consumer goods and rent expenses.
- **Groceries Index**: Compares the cost of groceries in different cities.
- **Restaurants Index**: Compares restaurant meal prices.
- **Local Purchasing Power**: Reflects purchasing power based on average net salaries compared to NYC.

### **4. Findings**

#### **4.1. Global Cost of Living Trends**

- **Most Affordable Countries**:
  - Pakistan: Cost of Living Index (Excl. Rent) = 20.4
  - Libya: Cost of Living Index (Excl. Rent) = 22.3
  - Egypt: Cost of Living Index (Excl. Rent) = 21.0

#### **4.2. Rent Index**
- **High Rent Countries**:
  - Singapore: Rent Index = 67.2
  - Hong Kong: Rent Index = 64.8
  - Switzerland: Rent Index = 63.5

  - Syria: Purchasing Power Index = 28.1
  - Cameroon: Purchasing Power Index = 10.5

### **5. Insights and Recommendations**

- **For Expats and Travelers**: Countries in South Asia and parts of Latin America offer lower costs of living. For instance, India and Pakistan have among the lowest cost of living indices, making them cost-effective for expats and travelers.
- **For Businesses**: In high-rent countries like Singapore and Switzerland, salary adjustments are necessary to maintain living standards. Conversely, in countries with lower living costs, such as Bangladesh and Pakistan, lower salary adjustments may suffice.
- **For Governments**: Countries with low local purchasing power but rising living costs, like Pakistan and Egypt, may need to adjust minimum wage policies to help residents manage increasing expenses.

### **6. Conclusion**
Analyzing cost of living data reveals significant global variations in affordability. Understanding these differences can guide individuals, businesses, and governments in making informed decisions related to cost management and relocation.

### **7. Tools Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express

### **8. Future Work**
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Examine cost of living trends over time.
- **Deeper Correlation Analysis**: Include variables such as inflation rates and employment rates.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Develop a real-time interactive dashboard for data exploration.
